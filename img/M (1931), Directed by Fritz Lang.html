Still can’t shake the feeling the movie etched onto me. The movie starts off like any other murder thriller. About a psychopath on the loose who kills little kids. Quite a popular fellow, everyone in the city seems to know and fear him. In fact, the movie opens with kids playing around singing a rhyme based on him.</span></p><p><span style="-aw-import:ignore">&#xa0;</span></p><p><span>Surprisingly, the movie doesn’t just revolve around the murderer, but the whole town. We learn about the murderer as much as it is known to others. Nothing special except his face is known to us the audience. The crowd mentality and the domino effect caused by the murders is the topic of interest here. The general public is enraged by the fact that a child murderer is out in the wild picking up and killing children thus pressuring the police department. The police in turn secure the neighborhood making it a problem for the underworld to operate.</span></p><p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/6/blog/post/edit/4156501105468271839/9150535704568749975" style="text-decoration:none"><img src="images/Aspose.Words.60c51909-7825-4af4-91ca-277503adcaac.002.jpeg" width="500" height="423" alt="A person in a hat looking at a mirror&#xA;&#xA;Description automatically generated with low confidence" style="border-style:none; -aw-left-pos:0pt; -aw-rel-hpos:column; -aw-rel-vpos:paragraph; -aw-top-pos:0pt; -aw-wrap-type:inline" /></a></p><p><span>The writing in the movie is a work of art. Considering and characterizing not just the murderer, but the three groups I spoke early about. The performances of almost all the characters are impeccable thanks to Fritz Lang. The editing and the cinematography actually fascinate me considering that the movie was made in 1931. I’m sure Lang would’ve done a helluva better job with the technology available now.</span></p><p><span style="-aw-import:ignore">&#xa0;</span></p><p><span>This movie defined the thriller genre for the upcoming years. Fritz Lang is the revolution the genre needed.</span></p></div></body></html>
